## Setup

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Oyindamolajames/Django-Crud-Project-Songcrud
$ cd Django-Crud-Project-Songcrud
```

Install pipenv and activate shell:
```
$ sudo pip3 install pipenv
$ pipenv shell
```

Note the (Songcrud) in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal session operates in a virtual environment set up by pipenv.

Once pip has finished downloading the dependencies:
```
(songcrud)$ cd project
(songcrud)$ python manage.py runserver
```
